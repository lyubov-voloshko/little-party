Blue represents tranquility, melancholy, loneliness and
fantasy. If the yellow color is the color to show Gatsby’s
outer self, the blue color, which is full of sadness and
fantasy, indicates Gatsby’s real inner self - lonely,
sorrowful and fanciful.

In the novel, Gatsby’s garden is described as blue, such
as the blue garden and blue livery occurred in the third
chapter, “the blue leaves” occurred in the eighth chapter
and the “blue lawn” occurred in the ninth chapter. The
blue tone of Gatsby’s garden reveals Gatsby’s loneliness
and melancholy in his inner heart. He holds lavish parties
in his blue garden to allure Daisy, but fails, which makes
him become more sad, lonely and melancholy. Though
holding the luxurious parties, he never takes part in them.
That is why the people who take part in the parties hold
speculation and debate on the real identity of Gatsby and
there are few people knowing or seeing the host of the free
parties. As to the reason why Gatsby does not take part in
his parties, it may be that the real Gatsby cannot merge
himself with those wealthy people and the tranquility in
his inner heart is contrary to the&nbsp;noise scenes.

Blue also symbolizes the fantasy and illusion of
dream. When the blue color is used to describe Gatsby,
it indicates that Gatsby is full of beautiful fantasy and
illusion towards his dream, Daisy. He believes firmly that
Daisy loves him sincerely in the depth of her heart all the
time and he will own Daisy one day in the future with his
enormous wealth and true love. In the end of the novel,
when Nick sees the blue smoke of leaves in the air, he
realizes that the disillusionment of the American Dream is
inevitable in such a roaring age. Then he decides to come
back home where own the&nbsp;traditional morality.
