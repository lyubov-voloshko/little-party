Red is associated with blood, so it is the symbol of
violence, danger and rage. Nick has bought a dozen books
on finance, which is red and gold standing on his shelf.
The gold color of these books represents money. While the
gold is associated with red here, it means that the worship
and obtain of money is closely associated with blood and
violence in that age. On the other hand, when Nick left
Daisy’s house, he saw “in front of wayside garages, where
new red gas-pumps sat out in pools of light.” (Ibid., p.170)
In this sentence, the author not only uses the color “red”,
but also uses the word “pool”, which indicates the ending
of the story. Here red represents the blood of Myrtle who
died in front of a gas station in the Valley of Ashes and the
blood of Gatsby who was shot in his swimming pool.

Xu Dawen said in his essay Dream & Illusion—
Symbolism in The Great Gatsby that, “Red and white were
fundamental tone of color in Daisy and Tom’s villa. Since
white symbolized personality characteristics of Daisy, red
can show Tom’s individual character: selfish, arrogant,
barbarous, and cruel.” (Xu,&nbsp;2013)

It is Tom’s enormous wealthy and superior family
background that makes him selfish, arrogant, defiant
and supercilious. And he always brutally swept anyone
standing in front of him aside. He is disloyal to his
marriage. Though he has married with Daisy, he often
trysts with his mistress, Mrs. Wilson. However, after
discovering his wife and Gatsby’s love affairs, he is so
selfish and arrogant that he unexpectedly takes his wife to
Gatsby only to prove that Gatsby cannot cause any harm
to him, from which we can see his arrogance and defiance.
After knowing Daisy kills his mistress unintentionally
by Gatsby’s car, out of envy, he instigates his mistress’s
husband to kill Gatsby, from which we can see his
selfishness and cruelty.
