No matter in the Oriental culture or in the Western culture,
green is the color of spring, which symbolizes confidence,
vitality and hope. In The Great Gatsby, the green color
runs throughout the whole novel, and it is closely related
to Gatsby’s short life. So it symbolizes Gatsby’s original
dream and hope, his ceaseless pursuit of his dream and
even the corruption of his dream and life.

The green color is closely associated with the green
light occurred in the novel, which is closely related to
Gatsby and the whole theme. The green light burning all
night occurs three times in the&nbsp;novel.

The first time when the green light occurs is at the end
of the first chapter. Nick saw that Gatsby was stretching
out his arms toward the dark water and was trembling.
“Involuntarily I glanced seaward - and distinguished
nothing except a single green light, minute and far away,
that might have been the end of a dock.” (Fitzgerald,
2013, p.169). Actually, the green light is just at the end
of Daisy’s dock. In Gatsby’s eyes, the green light just
represents Daisy, who is his lifelong pursuit and dream.
He thinks that the reason why Daisy breaks up their
engagement and is married to rich Tom is that he is too
poor. So he believes that he can win Daisy back only if he
earns enough money. Then he is full of hope at that time
and the green light is his hope and dream. Though the
light is minute and far away, he believes that only if he
tries his best to purse it, he can touch the green light, hold
his hope and realize his dream. But on the other hand, as
the light is always minute and far away, it symbolizes that
Gatsby’s dream is doomed to&nbsp;fail.

The second time when the green light occurs is in
the fifth chapter. At this time, Gatsby has successfully
shown his enormous fortune to Daisy and Daisy begins to
cry stormily when she faces Gatsby’s incredible wealth.
And Gatsby said to Daisy that “You always have a green
light that burns all night at the end of your dock.” (Ibid.,
p.226) It seems that he is nearly realizing his dream,
but he becomes lost in a deep reverie because of the big
difference between the real Daisy and his imaginary
Daisy. So now the green light seems to have lost its
original significance and the fascinating charm, which
symbolizes the big difference between the dream and
reality and indicates that the American Dream is beautiful
in the imagination but is fragility in the&nbsp;reality.

The third time when the green light occurs is at the end
of the novel. With the death of Gatsby, the people who
holds the faith in the light is not existed anymore, which
indicates the disillusionment of the American Dream.
“Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future
that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but
that’s no matter - tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out
our arms farther. And one fine morning” (Ibid., p.296) So,
besides the disillusionment of dream, the green light also
represents new hope and the ceaseless struggle towards
our&nbsp;dream.

The green light appears throughout the whole novel
makes the plot more complete and the theme more deep
and profound. Gatsby simply integrates his dream with
love and wealth, and gambles on Daisy, who is hollow,
selfish, greedy and indifferent. And in such a society
where is full of materialism, carefree hedonism and moral
decadence, Gatsby’s pursuit of his dream on the spiritual
level is incompatible with the social environment. So
Gatsby’s American Dream about winning back Daisy is
doomed to corrupt in the Jazz&nbsp;Age.
