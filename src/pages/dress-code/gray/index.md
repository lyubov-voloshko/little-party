Grey is the basic color tone that rules the whole novel.
It symbolizes decadence, bleakness, corruption and
disillusionment and represents moral decay, spiritual
emptiness and death.

The valley of ashes is a grey place where everything is
colored grey. There are also grey cars crawling along 
an invisible track and ash-grey men swarming up with 
leaden spades.

Just as Eliot’s “wasteland”, the valley is a spiritual
ruin of young man in the Jazz Age. Every grey thing in
the Valley of Ashes makes people feel depressed, hopeless
and afflicted. Besides the poor Valley of Ashes is grey,
there are many scenes is colored grey in the novel, for
example, the living room of Tom’s mistress is filled with
grey smoke; the guests in Gatsby’s parties have grey
names; the accident which kills Mrs. Wilson happens
in the dusk. All these grey scenes symbolize spiritual
emptiness, moral decadence, gloomy life and sad tragedy.

After Mrs. Wilson’s death, “Wilson’s glazed eyes
turned out to the ashheaps, where small grey clouds took
on fantastic shape.” (Ibid.) This indicates Mr. Wilson’s
painful state of mind and his determination to kill the
owner of the yellow car. Living in the world of money
worship, people’s spirit is empty and moral is decay, and
as if they are living in a lifeless desert where they are
putting up a last-ditch struggle for their life, hopelessly.

In the end of the story, the author describes that Gatsby
is killed by an ashen and fantastic figure. The appearance
of this grey figure just indicates Gatsby’s disillusionment
and death. It also means that all the things including
Gatsby’s dream and life are ended in the bleak and
gloomy tragic grey atmosphere.
