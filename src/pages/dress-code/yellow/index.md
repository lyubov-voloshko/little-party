Throughout the novel, it can be seen that the most
common color accompanying with Gatsby is yellow. With
this color, the author skillfully implies what kind of outer
self that Gatsby intends to show before others.
Yellow is the color of gold, which symbolizes money,
materialism and high social position. In Western culture,
the yellow color is the color that the aristocratic class uses
to decorate themselves, so it represents wealth and noble
identity as well as the gaiety and communication. Then in
order to win Daisy back, Gatsby chooses the yellow color
to decorate himself and his house to show that he has been
one member of the rich folk. As Gatsby naively thinks that
Daisy has never loved anyone else any more except him,
he engages himself in earning enormous wealth to win his
losing love back. After owning enough money, he keeps
himself in a golden world to show his wealth to Daisy:
His golden tie, yellow car, golden toilet set and even his
golden food and music in his lavish parties. What is more,
Doctor T. J. Eckleburg’s enormous spectacles are yellow
too. So all these yellow and golden things indicate that the
Jazz Age is an age where everyone shows great worship
of money and where the materialism is so fashionable that
even God cannot avoid its influence.

What is more, the author describes Daisy as a golden
girl. So yellow also symbolizes luxuriousness, greed and
coward. When Gatsby shows a pile of shirts before her,
Daisy cries stormily with her head bent into the shirts.
Even her voice is full of the sound of gold coin. All of
these show that what Daisy loves only is just money and
wealth and that she enjoys herself greedily in the wealthy
and luxurious life style. Regarding such a golden woman
as his dream, Gatsby is doomed to be disillusioned.
On the other hand, the yellow color is the color of
autumn leaves, which symbolizes decay, death and
destructive power. Before Gatsby was shot by Wilson,
it was depicted that he refused the chauffeur’s help and
disappeared among the yellowing trees in a moment,
which indicated his death. And his yellow car not only
ends Mrs. Wilson’s life, but also eventually leads to his
death. But it is Daisy who actually leads to Gatsby's

tragedy. So this color also indicates the failure of the
American Dream.
Yellow, the color that Gatsby is struggling all his life,
not only gives him confidence, but also destroys his dream
and life. So it reflects the characteristics of the times and
the fate of the people at that time.
