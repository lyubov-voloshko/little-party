White occurs many times in the novel, and it is closely
associated with&nbsp;Daisy.

White represents the immaculate and pure beauty. It
symbolizes nobleness and purity. It is Daisy’s color in
the novel. She wears white dress when she meets Gatsby
for the first time as well as when Nick visits her in the
East Egg. At the age of eighteen, she dressed in white and
had a white car, which made her charming in the eyes of
young officers. Her house is full of the color of white, for
example, “The windows were ajar and gleaming white

against the fresh grass outside” (Ibid., p.158) and “A
breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end
and out the other like pale flags.” (Ibid., p.246) Even her
name Daisy is also a kind of white flower. Thus it may
easily make people feel that she is pure, flawless, innocent
and noble when people meet her the first time. That is
why Gatsby is infatuated with her throughout his life and
regards her as a pure beauty and as his American Dream.

However, white actually symbolizes empty, vacuity,
superficiality, ruthlessness and selfish to a great extent
in the novel. Describing Daisy with the color of white, it
indicates that under the pure and beautiful appearance,
Daisy owns a superficial, hollow, cold and selfish heart
inside. Her life is full of nothing except luxury and
she wastes everyday in boringness and loneliness, for
example, Daisy once cried, “what’ll we do with ourselves
this afternoon, and the day after that, and the next thirty
years?” (Ibid., p.168) Thus she represents the hollow and
superficial upper class in the Jazz Age. What is more,
although Gatsby has run out of all his youth and passion
for her, even sacrifice his life, Daisy shows no grief for
his death but just goes out for traveling with her husband,
which reveals her selfish and indifferent personality. Thus
she represents the spirit and mood of the Jazz Age and the
hypocritical values and moral standards of the bourgeois.

White implies that although the upper class is rich
in their material life, they are quite poor and decadent
in their morality, and are irresponsible and insensitive
to the society, to their life and to other people. White
symbolizes Daisy’s emptiness, superficial, hypocrisy and
ignorance. Whereas Gatsby regards Daisy as his dream,
so it indicates that his dream is illusive and worthless, and
it also implies that his American Dream is doomed to be
corrupted.
