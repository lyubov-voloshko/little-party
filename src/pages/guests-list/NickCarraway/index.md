**Nick Carraway**

a Yale University graduate originating from the Midwest, a World War I veteran, and, at the start of the plot, a newly
arrived resident of West Egg, who is aged 29 (later 30). He also serves as the first-person narrator of the novel.
He is Gatsby's next-door neighbor and a bond salesman. He is easy-going, occasionally sarcastic, and somewhat optimistic,
although this latter quality fades as the novel progresses. He is a more grounded character than the others, and more
practical, and is always in awe of other characters' lifestyles and morals.
