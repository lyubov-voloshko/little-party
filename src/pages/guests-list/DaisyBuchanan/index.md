An attractive though shallow and self-absorbed, young Louisville,
Kentucky debutante and socialite, identified as a flapper. She is Nick's second cousin,
once removed, and the wife of Tom Buchanan. Daisy once had a romantic relationship with Gatsby,
before she married Tom. Her choice between Gatsby and Tom is one of the central conflicts in
the novel. Daisy is believed to have been inspired by Fitzgerald's own youthful romances
with Ginevra King.
