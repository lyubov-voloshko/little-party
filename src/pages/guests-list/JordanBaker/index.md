A professional golfer and Daisy Buchanan's long-time friend with a sarcastic streak and
an aloof attitude. She is Nick Carraway's girlfriend for most of the novel, though they
grow apart towards the end. She has a slightly shady reputation amongst the New York
social elite, due to her habit of being evasive and untruthful with her friends and lovers.
She established herself as a professional golfer in a predominantly male sport. With great
success came criticism as she faced a scandal of cheating, which harmed her reputation as
a golfer. Fitzgerald told Maxwell Perkins that Jordan was based on the golfer Edith Cummings,
a friend of Ginevra King.[13] Her name is a play on the two popular automobile brands,
the Jordan Motor Car Company and the Baker Motor Vehicle, alluding to Jordan's "fast"
reputation and the freedom now presented to Americans, especially women, in the 1920s.
