There are also grey cars crawling along\nan invisible track and ash-grey men swarming up with\nleaden spades.</p>\n<p>Just as Eliot’s “wasteland”, the valley is a spiritual\nruin of young man in the Jazz Age. Every grey thing in\nthe Valley of Ashes makes people feel depressed, hopeless\nand afflicted. Besides the poor Valley of Ashes is grey,\nthere are many scenes is colored grey in the novel, for\nexample, the living room of Tom’s mistress is filled with\ngrey smoke; the guests in Gatsby’s parties have grey\nnames; the accident which kills Mrs. Wilson happens\nin the dusk. All these grey scenes symbolize spiritual\nemptiness, moral decadence, gloomy life and sad tragedy.</p>\n<p>After Mrs. Wilson’s death, “Wilson’s glazed eyes\nturned out to the ashheaps, where small grey clouds took\non fantastic shape.” (Ibid.) This indicates Mr. Wilson’s\npainful state of mind and his determination to kill the\nowner of the yellow car. Living in the world of money\nworship, people’s spirit is empty and moral is decay, and\nas if they are living in a lifeless desert where they are\nputting up a last-ditch struggle for their life, hopelessly.</p>\n<p>In the end of the story, the author describes that Gatsby\nis killed by an ashen and fantastic figure. The appearance\nof this grey figure just indicates Gatsby’s disillusionment\nand death. It also means that all the things including\nGatsby’s dream and life are ended in the bleak and\ngloomy tragic grey atmosphere.</p>",frontmatter:{name:"Gray",hexCode:"#f0f0f0",photoBackground:"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c2/a0/0e/c2a00e1b85ef213f39feb4dcb6824e77.png"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/dress-code/gray/"}}}});
