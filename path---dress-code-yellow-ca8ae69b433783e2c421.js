With\nthis color, the author skillfully implies what kind of outer\nself that Gatsby intends to show before others.\nYellow is the color of gold, which symbolizes money,\nmaterialism and high social position. In Western culture,\nthe yellow color is the color that the aristocratic class uses\nto decorate themselves, so it represents wealth and noble\nidentity as well as the gaiety and communication. Then in\norder to win Daisy back, Gatsby chooses the yellow color\nto decorate himself and his house to show that he has been\none member of the rich folk. As Gatsby naively thinks that\nDaisy has never loved anyone else any more except him,\nhe engages himself in earning enormous wealth to win his\nlosing love back. After owning enough money, he keeps\nhimself in a golden world to show his wealth to Daisy:\nHis golden tie, yellow car, golden toilet set and even his\ngolden food and music in his lavish parties. What is more,\nDoctor T. J. Eckleburg’s enormous spectacles are yellow\ntoo. So all these yellow and golden things indicate that the\nJazz Age is an age where everyone shows great worship\nof money and where the materialism is so fashionable that\neven God cannot avoid its influence.</p>\n<p>What is more, the author describes Daisy as a golden\ngirl. So yellow also symbolizes luxuriousness, greed and\ncoward. When Gatsby shows a pile of shirts before her,\nDaisy cries stormily with her head bent into the shirts.\nEven her voice is full of the sound of gold coin. All of\nthese show that what Daisy loves only is just money and\nwealth and that she enjoys herself greedily in the wealthy\nand luxurious life style. Regarding such a golden woman\nas his dream, Gatsby is doomed to be disillusioned.\nOn the other hand, the yellow color is the color of\nautumn leaves, which symbolizes decay, death and\ndestructive power. Before Gatsby was shot by Wilson,\nit was depicted that he refused the chauffeur’s help and\ndisappeared among the yellowing trees in a moment,\nwhich indicated his death. And his yellow car not only\nends Mrs. Wilson’s life, but also eventually leads to his\ndeath. But it is Daisy who actually leads to Gatsby's</p>\n<p>tragedy. So this color also indicates the failure of the\nAmerican Dream.\nYellow, the color that Gatsby is struggling all his life,\nnot only gives him confidence, but also destroys his dream\nand life. So it reflects the characteristics of the times and\nthe fate of the people at that time.</p>",frontmatter:{name:"Yellow",hexCode:"#ffff00"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/dress-code/yellow/"}}}});
