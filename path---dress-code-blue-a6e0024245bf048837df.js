If the yellow color is the color to show Gatsby’s\nouter self, the blue color, which is full of sadness and\nfantasy, indicates Gatsby’s real inner self - lonely,\nsorrowful and fanciful.</p>\n<p>In the novel, Gatsby’s garden is described as blue, such\nas the blue garden and blue livery occurred in the third\nchapter, “the blue leaves” occurred in the eighth chapter\nand the “blue lawn” occurred in the ninth chapter. The\nblue tone of Gatsby’s garden reveals Gatsby’s loneliness\nand melancholy in his inner heart. He holds lavish parties\nin his blue garden to allure Daisy, but fails, which makes\nhim become more sad, lonely and melancholy. Though\nholding the luxurious parties, he never takes part in them.\nThat is why the people who take part in the parties hold\nspeculation and debate on the real identity of Gatsby and\nthere are few people knowing or seeing the host of the free\nparties. As to the reason why Gatsby does not take part in\nhis parties, it may be that the real Gatsby cannot merge\nhimself with those wealthy people and the tranquility in\nhis inner heart is contrary to the noise scenes.</p>\n<p>Blue also symbolizes the fantasy and illusion of\ndream. When the blue color is used to describe Gatsby,\nit indicates that Gatsby is full of beautiful fantasy and\nillusion towards his dream, Daisy. He believes firmly that\nDaisy loves him sincerely in the depth of her heart all the\ntime and he will own Daisy one day in the future with his\nenormous wealth and true love. In the end of the novel,\nwhen Nick sees the blue smoke of leaves in the air, he\nrealizes that the disillusionment of the American Dream is\ninevitable in such a roaring age. Then he decides to come\nback home where own the traditional morality.</p>",frontmatter:{name:"Blue",hexCode:"#F0F0FF",photoBackground:"https://img00.deviantart.net/f932/i/2016/102/4/0/dr_tj_eckleburg_by_hasunkhan-d5hwgkj.jpg"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/dress-code/blue/"}}}});
